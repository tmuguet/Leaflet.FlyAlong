# Leaflet FlyAlong

Leaflet FlyAlong is a plugin for [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) to move the view of the map with a smooth animation along a `L.PolyLine` object.

## Methods

This plugin adds one method to `L.Polyline` objects:

- `flyTo(latlng: L.LatLng, zoom?: number, options?: Zoom/pan options)`: sets the view of the map (geographical center and zoom) performing a smooth pan-zoom animation along this polyline.  
If the starting point for the animation is not on the polyline, there will be a first animation towards its closest point on the polyline.  
If the ending point for the animation is not on the polyline, there will be a last animation from its closest point on the polyline.  
**Note**: Zoom/pan options `easeLinearity` and `noMoveStart` are not supported.


## Events

This plugin defines two events:

- `FlyAlong:movestart`: fired when the animation started
- `FlyAlong:moveend`: fired when the animation is finished

**Warning**: as this plugin relies on the `L.Map.flyTo` method, it triggers a lot of `movestart` and `moveend` events during the animation. If your application relies on these events, you should either disable your listeners or implement a way to ignore these events ðŸ˜¬. I'm open to suggestions to avoid this ðŸ‘‹!
